                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Hi my name is Will, I have recently began studying programming and front-end development. 
                        I have been studying very consistenly for about 6 months now. 
                        Previous to this I also had studied some computer science in university, which included studies in discrete mathematics and other mainly maths based courses.
                        This is my first proper project I have decided to add to my portfolio, however I have been working on many small projects for quite a while now.
                        I am looking to get into front-end devlopment as a career and am very excited to progress and learn more</p>
